In SQL, a common yet easily overlooked error is the implicit type conversion during comparisons.  Consider this scenario:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = '123';
```

If `product_id` is an integer column, the string '123' will be implicitly converted to an integer. This might seem harmless, but it can lead to unexpected results if the conversion fails. For example, if `product_id` is defined as `INT` and there's a value such as '123a', that comparison would evaluate to false, potentially missing data.

Another example is comparing values of different data types. In the following example, if `price` is a `DECIMAL` or `FLOAT` column and we compare it to an integer literal:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE price = 10;
```

The implicit conversion might lead to subtle inaccuracies and inconsistent comparisons if the price has decimal parts.
